      Do you remember the game Simon says from the 80s? I don’t know about you, but I know many that spent hours trying to press those specific sequences of red, green, blue and yellow buttons in the correct order. But why play on your own? We’ve implemented a gRPC server that allows you to play Simon with other players over the internet!

      In this workshop we will dive into the toolset and libraries to build your very own Simon Says client for this server. We will have a message description in Protocol Buffers format and some stub code in several languages ready for you to play with. The goal for this workshop is for you to have a working client that you can use to play (and beat!) other attendees of the workshop.

      solutions. Sascha will discuss the purpose and guide you through this complex

      Storing account information is a common challenge many app developers face, and is often tackled in tailored solutions. Isn't there some strategy to store account credentials in a centralized place?

      What about considerations for multiple accounts? Security concerns? And when should or could I synchronize data?

      Android offers a powerful—and underrated—account manager. Let's explore the possibilities together and lay out an architecture for engineering an Android app based on accounts.

      One of my favourite things about the web are ASCII smileys. They're sweet, fun and simply make the web a better place. How could anyone not like them ¯(ツ)/¯?

      This talk is an overdose of smileys, because they're the perfect excuse to get started with Polymer. Polymer is a library built on top of the Web Components standards that helps developers create reusable components for the modern web. And since I know that everybody has been wondering how one could take over the world by creating a suite of Polymer animated emoticon components, we're going to do exactly that.
